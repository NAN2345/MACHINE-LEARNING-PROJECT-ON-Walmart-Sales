# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-ON-Walmart-Sales-Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting Walmart's weekly sales using machine learning models. The dataset used contains information such as date, temperature, fuel price, CPI (Consumer Price Index), unemployment rate, and weekly sales.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- catboost

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost catboost
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/walmart-sales-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd walmart-sales-prediction
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook Walmart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and analyze the results.

## Contents

- `Walmart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `Walmart_sales.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the models.
